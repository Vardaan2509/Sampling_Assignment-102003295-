This is an assignment based on Sampling submitted for the course UCS654(Predictive Analytics using Statistics) by Vardaan Khosla.

# Sampling 
Sampling techniques are methods used to select a representative subset of a population for study or analysis. In statistics, the population is the entire group of individuals, items, or data points that the researcher is interested in, while a sample is a smaller, manageable subset of the population that is selected for analysis.

Sampling techniques can be classified as probability or non-probability sampling techniques.

**Probability** sampling is a sampling technique where each member of the population has a known and equal chance of being selected for the sample. This means that every individual or item in the population has a fair and unbiased opportunity to be chosen.

**Non-probability** sampling is a sampling technique where the selection of the sample is not based on random selection, and not all members of the population have an equal chance of being selected. 

**Step 1** -> We will load our dataset "Creditcard_data.csv". Refer to :https://github.com/Vardaan2509/Sampling_Assignment-102003295-/blob/main/Creditcard_data.csv
Since, this is an unbalanced datset so we need to balance it using techniques such as **oversampling, undersampling**,etc.
Balancing a dataset refers to the process of addressing class imbalance in a dataset. Class imbalance occurs when the number of samples in one class is significantly larger or smaller than the number of samples in other classes. Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased results in machine learning models, where the model may favor the larger class due to its prevalence in the dataset.

**Step 2** -> Create and load the new dataset "Balanced_data.csv". Refer to :https://github.com/Vardaan2509/Sampling_Assignment-102003295-/blob/main/Balanced_data.csv

**Step 3** -> Apply different sampling techniques to generate smaller sample datsets from the original dataset.

The techniques used in our code(https://github.com/Vardaan2509/Sampling_Assignment-102003295-/blob/main/Sampling_Code.ipynb) for creating the samples are:
1. **Simple random sampling**: This is the most basic sampling technique, where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.
2. **Stratified sampling**: This involves dividing the population into subgroups or strata, and then selecting a random sample from each stratum based on the proportion of the population they represent.
3. **Cluster sampling**: This technique involves dividing the population into clusters or groups, and then randomly selecting a few clusters for inclusion in the sample.
4. **Systematic sampling**: This involves selecting every nth member of the population to be included in the sample.
5. **Convenience sampling**: This is a non-probability sampling technique where the researcher selects the individuals that are easiest to access based on resource/time constraints.

**Step 4** -> Apply various Machine learning based classification models on the samples generated by all the techniques and calculate the accuracy of each model with respect to each sample. This can be made a lot more faster and easier by using the PyCaret library.

**Step 5** -> Compare the accuracies.

# Obseravtions/Conclusions:
The highest accuracy(0.9986) is being achieved by using the combination of Cluster Sampling Technique + Random Forest Classifier.
